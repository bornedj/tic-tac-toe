The player class keeps track of a players name and number of wins.

The game_class is then class that keeps track of a tic tac toe board. It contains the methods that check to see which player has one a game or if a game is a tie. 
It also has the method that keeps track of the board through player turns.

repeated games to be played with the same players.
